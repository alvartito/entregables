1	And now, the end is near
2	And so I face the final curtain
3	My friend, I'll say it clear
4	I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
5	I've lived a life that's full
6	I traveled each and ev'ry highway
7	And more, much more than this, I did it my way
8	 
9	Regrets, I've had a few
10	But then again, too few to mention
11	I did what I had to do , I saw it through without exemption
12	I planned each charted course, each careful step along the highway
13	And more, much more than this, I did it my way
14	 
15	Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
16	When I bit off more than I could chew
17	And through it all, when there was doubt
18	I ate it up and spit it out
19	I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
20	 
21	I've loved, I've laughed and cried
22	I've had my fill, my share of losing
23	And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing
24	To think I did all that
25	And may I say, not in a shy way,
26	"Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way"
27	 
28	For what is a man, what has he got?
29	If not himself, then he has naught
30	The right to say the things he feels and not the words of one who kneels
31	The record shows I took the blows and did it my way!
