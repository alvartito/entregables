1	Start spreading the news
2	I am leaving today
3	I want to be a part of it
4	New York, New York
5	 
6	These vagabond shoes
7	They are longing to stray
8	Right through the very heart of it
9	New York, New York
10	 
11	I want to wake up in that city
12	That doesn't sleep
13	And find I'm king of the hill
14	Top of the heap
15	 
16	My little town blues
17	They are melting away
18	I gonna make a brand new start of it
19	In old New York
20	 
21	If I can make it there
22	I'll make it anywhere
23	It's up to you
24	New York, New York
25	 
26	New York, New York
27	I want to wake up in that city
28	That never sleeps
29	And find I'm king of the hill
30	Top of the list
31	Head of the heap
32	King of the hill
33	 
34	These are little town blues
35	They have all melted away
36	I am about to make a brand new start of it
37	Right there in old New York
