1	I've got you under my skin.
2	I've got you deep in the heart of me.
3	So deep in my heart that you're really a part of me.
4	I've got you under my skin.
5	I'd tried so not to give in.
6	I said to myself: this affair never will go so well.
7	But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know down well
8	I've got you under my skin?
9	 
10	I'd sacrifice anything come what might
11	For the sake of havin' you near
12	In spite of a warnin' voice that comes in the night
13	And repeats, repeats in my ear:
14	Don't you know, you fool, you never can win?
15	Use your mentality, wake up to reality.
16	But each time that I do just the thought of you
17	Makes me stop before I begin
18	'Cause I've got you under my skin.
19	 
20	I would sacrifice anything come what might
21	For the sake of havin' you near
22	In spite of the warning voice that comes in the night
23	And repeats - how it yells in my ear:
24	Don't you know, you fool, ainÂ´t no chance to win
25	Why not use your mentality - get up, wake up to reality?
26	And each time I do just the thought of you
27	Makes me stop just before I begin
28	'Cause I've got you under my skin.
29	And I like you under my skin.
