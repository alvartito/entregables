1	When I was seventeen
2	It was a very good year
3	It was a very good year for small town girls
4	And soft summer nights
5	Wed hide from the lights
6	On the village green
7	When I was seventeen
8	 
9	When I was twenty-one
10	It was a very good year
11	It was a very good year for city girls
12	Who lived up the stair
13	With all that perfumed hair
14	And it came undone
15	When I was twenty-one
16	 
17	When I was thirty-five
18	It was a very good year
19	It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
20	Of independent means
21	Wed ride in limousines
22	Their chauffeurs would drive
23	When I was thirty-five
24	 
25	But now the days grow short
26	Im in the autumn of the year
27	And now I think of my life as vintage wine
28	>from fine old kegs
29	>from the brim to the dregs
30	And it poured sweet and clear
31	It was a very good year
32	 
33	It was a mess of good years
